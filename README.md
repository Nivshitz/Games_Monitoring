# Game Installation Monitoring & Alert System

## Overview

This project is a Python-based monitoring system designed to track the installation trends of mobile games. The system uses real-time data from the Google Play Store to monitor installations and identify significant spikes or trends in game popularity. Alerts are triggered if installation growth exceeds a defined threshold, allowing for timely analysis and decision-making.

The project consists of three core components:
1. **Game Data Collection**: Fetches daily installation counts for selected games from the Google Play Store.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Monitors installation growth over time, calculating percentage increases.
3. **Alert System**: Triggers alerts if a game's installation count shows a significant increase, allowing further investigation.

## Features

- **Automated Data Collection**: Fetches installation data for multiple games daily using the Google Play Scraper API.
- **Trend Analysis**: Calculates average percentage increases over a customizable period (e.g., 7 days).
- **Alerts**: Generates alerts when installation growth exceeds the set threshold.
- **Data Storage**: Uses MySQL to store game and installation data.
- **Scalable**: The system automatically adjusts to new games and scales with more data points.
